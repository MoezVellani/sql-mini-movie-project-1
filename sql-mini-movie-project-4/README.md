In this SQL project, I analyzed a movie dataset to identify the top 10 actors and actresses with the highest average movie scores. 
Using SQL aggregation functions like AVG(), GROUP BY and HAVING, I filtered for stars whose films consistently received high ratings (average score > 8). 
The results were sorted in descending order to spotlight the highest performers based on overall film ratings.
