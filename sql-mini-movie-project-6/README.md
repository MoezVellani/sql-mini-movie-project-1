In this project, I queried NBA data for the 2022-2023 season to find the top 10 most efficient scorers based on True Shooting Percentage. By filtering players with at least 40 games 
played, I ensured the rankings reflected consistent contributors. This project reinforced filtering with WHERE, ordering results, and limiting output in SQL.
