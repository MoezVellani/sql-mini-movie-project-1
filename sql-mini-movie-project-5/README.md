In this SQL mini project, I analyzed a movie dataset to identify the actor or actress with the most appearances for each rating category (G, PG, and R). Using table aliases, aggregation 
functions, and a correlated subquery with a HAVING clause, I filtered the dataset to return only the top star for each rating based on the number of appearances. This project helped 
reinforce my understanding of grouping by multiple columns, using subqueries for conditional aggregation, and organizing results in a readable format using ORDER BY.
