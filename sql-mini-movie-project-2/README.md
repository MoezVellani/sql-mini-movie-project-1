This SQL mini project retrieves the highest-rated movie in each genre from a movie dataset. It uses a correlated subquery to compare each movieâ€™s score against the maximum score within its genre, effectively filtering for top performers per category.

Key Concepts Practiced:   

Correlated subqueries to compare rows within the same table    

Table aliasing for cleaner, more readable queries   

Combining filtering with grouping logic

Objective:
To deepen understanding of advanced querying techniques for finding specific records based on group-level comparisons.
