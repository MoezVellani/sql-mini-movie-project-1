This is a SQL mini project focused on practicing essential database querying skills.

The project uses a movie dataset and demonstrates how to: 

  Select specific columns (name, rating, star) 

  Filter data using ther WHERE clause (specifically movies rated 'R') 

  Limit query results to a subset using LIMIT

This simple query highlights foundational SQL concepts such as filtering and result limiting.
